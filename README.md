# Perceptron Spam Classification Project

## Overview
This project implements a Perceptron-based machine learning algorithm to classify spam emails. It includes functions for vocabulary creation, training, and testing of the model using a custom dataset.
data is from SpamAssassin Public Corpus
## Features
- File splitting for training and validation datasets.
- Vocabulary creation based on word frequency thresholds.
- Training using the Perceptron algorithm.
- Error calculation for both training and validation datasets.
- Important word analysis for insights into feature weights.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Matplotlib
- Any other libraries required (e.g., collections, math, time)

To install the dependencies, run:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
